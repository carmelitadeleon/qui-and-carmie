              <p> We both first met each other during confirmation class at St. Mary Magdalen Parish, and little did we realize that this meeting would forever change our lives. Like most couples, we both started off as friends after we had reconnected through a series of messages through Facebook. This friendship would later lead us to become a couple as we both had realized how much we cared for each other.</p><br>
	            <p>In February of 2018 before I (Qui) left for an overseas military deployment to Afghanistan, we decided to make it official as a couple and share our love for one another. Throughout this time on deployment, most couples would waver and weaken because of this distance, but our love instead flourished and became stronger. When I returned home on December of the same year, we immediately introduced each other to our families and our love from then on would only continue to flourish.</p><br>
	            <p>Fast forward five years later, after lasting through a pandemic, I requested permission from Carmelita’s parents to propose to her. On December 12, 2023 I proposed to Carmelita at the Bellevue Botanical Gardens, where she said yes!<br>
	            <p>We can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives together and we are excited to share this special moment with our families and close friends!
